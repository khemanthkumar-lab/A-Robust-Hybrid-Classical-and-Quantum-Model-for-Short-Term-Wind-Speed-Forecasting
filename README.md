A Robust Hybrid Classical and Quantum Model for Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting


This project focuses on creating a resilient hybrid classicalâ€“quantum model for short-term wind speed prediction, tackling the growing complexities faced by power utilities. The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources, especially wind power, brings significant uncertainty and randomness to power scheduling, highlighting the urgent need for precise and dependable forecasting techniques.

The proposed approach integrates two advanced methods: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, renowned for capturing patterns over time in sequential data, and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), also called a parameterized quantum circuit. Leveraging quantum gates rooted in quantum mechanics, QNNs provide greater expressive capabilities, potentially surpassing traditional models in identifying intricate patterns.

To ensure consistent performance across different seasons and data variations, the project employs the Taguchi method for hyperparameter tuning. This strategy systematically tests various parameter combinations through orthogonal array experiments, resulting in a more stable and optimized model design.

The model development uses historical wind speed records from seven locations across Taiwan, the Philippines, China, and South Korea, aiming to predict wind speeds 24 hours in advance at the Fuhai wind farm in Taiwan. Accurate forecasting is key to enhancing the reliability and efficiency of integrating wind energy into the power system.

Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model clearly outperforms several existing top-tier models, such as the Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network (NAR), Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and the conventional LSTM network. These findings highlight the strong potential of blending quantum technologies with classical machine learning to solve real-world forecasting problems in the energy sector.

In summary, this project delivers a novel and powerful solution for short-term wind speed forecasting, promoting greater stability and operational efficiency in modern energy infrastructures.
